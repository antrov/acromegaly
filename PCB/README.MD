# Acromegaly PCB

[Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview) files used to design and manufacture the base PCB with a BLE controller and driver connectors. Besides, board includes an op-amp used to amplify current measurements for ADC, as well as a 8MB Flash memory.

* Mask for slot detector - [PDF](https://github.com/antrov/acromegaly/tree/master/PCB/gap_mask.pdf)

## Flashing

During development on DK board, flashing is done by integrated JLink (SEGGER) programmer. In order to flash Acromegaly PCB it is necessary to connect DK VVC/GND instead of LM3671 and SWDIO/SWCLK to dedicated PCB connectors accoriding to [following rules](https://electronut.in/nrf51-dk-external-programming/)
